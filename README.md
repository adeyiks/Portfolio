- This project shows the KPI visualisation of a mega store using only excel and pivot to create an interactive dashboard.

## PREDICTION OF ONSET OF AUTISM IN KIDS USING FACE SECTIONS

-Utilised the use of advance visual Computing in conjunction with Python Programming Language. Using models such as MediaPipe, DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, Xception and Inception. Successfully dissect faces into segments and determine the possibility of predicting Autism using Machine Learning models like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes and Decision Tree. Successfully establish the possibility of predicting onset of Autism in Children using Face segments up to 80% accuracy.
